How To Setup Ansible AWS Dynamic Inventory

When you are using Ansible with AWS, its very hard to maintain the inventory file as AWS has frequently changing IP’s, autoscaling instances and much more. 
However, there is an easy solution called ansible dynamic inventory. It is basically a python script which makes an API call to get the instance information when you run the ansible commands. 
This will give you dynamic inventory details to manage the AWS infrastructure.

Steps to setup AWS Dynamic Inventory.

---> Dynamci inventory for AWS using boto and python script. 

1. Install the boto library using pip.
  # pip install boto

2. Download the Inventory Script to /etc/ansible directory.
  # wget https://raw.github.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.py

3. Make the file executable.
 # chmod +x ec2.py

4. Download the ec2.ini file to /etc/ansible directory.
  # https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ansible/ansible/devel/contrib/inventory/ec2.ini

5. ec2.ini file has the default AWS configurations which are read by ec2.py file. Comment-out & configure the necessary parameter to avoid long query times, such as “regions” parameter. 
   By default, the value is “all”, this makes API calls to all the regions, better to mention only the specific aws region that we use.

Under the [credentials] section you need to mention the aws access key and private key to for the boto library to make the API call.

Alternatively, you can create a credentials file in your home as shown below.

touch ~/.aws/credentials
Open the credentials file and make the entries as shown below.

[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY

6. Now test the inventory configure using the following command.
   # ./ec2.py --list

   The output should be as below.

{
  "_meta": {
    "hostvars": {}
  }
}

If you have some instances up and running, you will get the output with all the instance details.

7. If you want to use the dynamic inventory as a default ansible inventory, you need to edit the ansible.cfg file present in /etc/ansible directory and search for inventory parameter in the ansible.cfg. 
   Change the inventory parameter value as shown below.
   
 # inventory      = /etc/ansible/ec2.py

 Now you can run the normal ansible commands against the dynamic inventory. For example, the following command will run a ping command against all the running ec2 instances fetched using the dynamic inventory.

 # ansible all -m ping
